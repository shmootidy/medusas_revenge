# Medusa's Revenge – Part I

This is a project I started at the beginning of year 2 of the pandemic – something to keep me sane (or perhaps tip me closer to the brink of madness, depending on your perspective) and just for fun.

In it, you play Medusa, the much-maligned Gorgon of Greek Mythology, as she navigates Minos's labyrinth in search of the Minotaur, in whom she recognizes another mistreated soul of Classical world, and with whom she plans on breaking free and taking vengeance against the gods and men who have wronged them both.

Navigate through near-identical rooms, finding keys and other treasures to help find your way through.

Will you find the monster?

(No. No, you will not. I haven't gotten that far in building the game yet.)

## About this project
This game took me 2 weeks to build, with a few straggly days tacked on the end to handle some of the loose pieces.

This is what I learned: 
* Hand-painting assets is fun, but uploading them and turning them into digital assest is not. I shan't be doing that again!
* Getting all the images to be responsive and sit properly in any screen size was an exercise in CSS. But a successful one!
* Feature-creep is a problem I learned to bat down successfully in this project. My original design for this game had several more room-types and interactions, and during development I came up with several more. As I began to apply the assets, I realized I was building a mammoth set of tasks for myself and I quickly began culling all but the most important features.

## More to do
Aside from building two other levels to the game so that you can actually meet and liberate the Minotaur, I'd like to fix a little glitch in there that requires the user to click on some items twice before they are added to the inventory. In the interest of The Other Things One Must Do In Life, I'm calling this my MVP and getting it up and out there.

## Feedback requested
What do you think of the game? Is there anything you'd like to see changed? Is there anything that doesn't make sense or is more frustrating than fun?

Let me know what you think!
